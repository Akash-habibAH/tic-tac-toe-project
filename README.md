# Tic Tac Toe Game
<pre>
This is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe with 9 boxes.
Each box has a light grey color: rgb(241, 240, 240).
We added border to the boxes, but only on some sides so they look separated from each other.
When you hover over a box, its color changes to rgb(203, 203, 203).
All 9 boxes appear with an animation from the left and stop in the center.
We used flexbox to make 3 boxes appear in each row.
Container is fully centered on the page.
On top of it, there is a box that shows whose turn it is.
This box also has an animation; it comes from the top and stops below.
Below the container, there is a group of 4 boxes:
The first 2 boxes show each player’s score.
The background color of these boxes is green: rgb(15, 103, 25), and the text color is white.
After that, there is a message box:
If the game is a tie, it shows “No winner!”.
If someone wins, it shows the winner’s name and stops the game.
At the bottom, there is a Reset button:
The button has a green background: rgb(15, 103, 25) and white text.
When you click the button, a box shadow appears around it.
Clicking this button clears all the Xs and Os in the boxes and resets the game.
The text color inside the boxes is black.
